Group activity to create a chrome extension.

## Project Description
The GitHub commands tip extension offers immediate help and hint on certain commands to people who are unfamiliar with the essential GitHub features. With help from the information, new contributors no longer have to google them one by one, but rather get helped with immediate display for hint for commands. Such project would enhance the user experience with GitHub and contributing to open source projects, especially when they are new to the system and unfamiliar with the hidden features.
