# OSSD_group_Extension
Group activity to create a chrome extension.


This extention aims to provide contact info for the github users. We were inspired by the linkedin extention we've used when networking with people during the recruiting seasons. With such extention, we can directly get the email for the linkedin user that we would like to make personal interactions with.

With that being said, the extention for github user email offers help when someone's trying to contact the members of a repository or project for building personal connections and exchanging meaningful ideas. We believe that it would be very helpful with the dynamic of open source engineering.
