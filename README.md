## Project Description
The GitHub Commands Tip extension offers immediate help and hints on certain commands for people who are unfamiliar with essential GitHub features. With this information, new contributors no longer have to Google commands one by one but can instead receive instant hints. This project enhances the developers' experience with GitHub and open-source contributions, especially for those who are new to the system and unaware of its hidden features.
