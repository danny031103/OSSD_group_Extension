# OSSD_group_Extension
Group activity to create a chrome extension.

## Project Description
This extention aims to provide contact info for the github users. We were inspired by the LinkedIn extension we've used when networking with people during the recruiting seasons. With such an extension, we can directly get the email for the Github user that we would like to interact with.

With that being said, the extension for Github user's email offers help when someone's trying to contact the members of a repository or project for building personal connections and exchanging meaningful ideas. We believe that it would be very helpful with the dynamic of open source engineering.
